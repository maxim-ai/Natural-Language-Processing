# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Hello,  welcome to the NLP assignments.

There are three assignments regarding the natural language process:

- Noisy Channel and a Probabilistic Spell Checker
- Text classification and Authorship Attribution
- Part of Speech (POS) Tagging

### Noisy Channel and a Probabilistic Spell Checker
A spell checker that handles both non-word and real-word errors given in a sentential context. 
\
The spell checker builds a language model and with a noisy chanel and probabilistic
evaluations checks
\
whether the sentence has a spelling error and corrects it.

### Text classification and Authorship Attribution
A classifier that uses various algorithms for text classification, performing an authorship attribution task on tweets.
\
The whole process includes a train/test splitting, feature extraction, using 4 algorithms (Logistic regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, FFNN)
\
and accuracy measurement (K-fold cross validation).

### Part of Speech (POS) Tagging
A tagger that uses a Hidden Markov generative sequence model (HMM) to tag parts of speech of a given sentence.
